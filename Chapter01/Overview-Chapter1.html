        <h1>Data Engineering Overview</h1>
        <p>Data Engineering is the practice of designing and building systems for collecting, storing, and analyzing data at scale. It plays a crucial role in enabling data-driven decision-making in organizations.</p>
        
        <h2>ETL Process</h2>
        <p>ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load, which is a process used in data engineering to gather data from multiple sources, process it, and store it in a data warehouse or database.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Extract</h3>
        <p>Extracting data involves collecting data from various sources such as databases, APIs, logs, and flat files.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Transform</h3>
        <p>During transformation, raw data is cleaned, normalized, and enriched to make it useful for analysis.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Load</h3>
        <p>Loading involves storing the transformed data into a target system such as a data warehouse for further use.</p>
        
        <h2>Role of Python in Data Engineering</h2>
        <p>Python is a key language in data engineering due to its simplicity, versatility, and vast ecosystem of libraries.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Data Extraction</h3>
        <p>Python libraries like <code>requests</code>, <code>beautifulsoup4</code>, and <code>pandas</code> help extract data from APIs, web pages, and files.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Data Transformation</h3>
        <p>Libraries like <code>pandas</code>, <code>numpy</code>, and <code>PySpark</code> allow efficient manipulation and processing of large datasets.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Data Loading</h3>
        <p>Python supports various databases with libraries such as <code>SQLAlchemy</code> and <code>psycopg2</code> to store data into databases.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Workflow Automation</h3>
        <p>Tools like <code>Airflow</code> and <code>Luigi</code> help automate and schedule ETL pipelines.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Big Data Processing</h3>
        <p>Python integrates with Hadoop, Spark, and other big data technologies for handling large-scale data processing.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Data Engineering is essential for modern data-driven businesses, and Python provides powerful tools to simplify data extraction, transformation, and storage efficiently.</p>
